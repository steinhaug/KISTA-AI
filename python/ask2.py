GPT-4 says: RECIPE: Gourmet Salsa Parmigiano Stuffed Baked Olives with Mustard Sweetcorn Sauce 

COUNTRY/REGION OF ORIGIN: Italian-Mexican Fusion

PREPARATION TIME: 30 minutes

ESTIMATED CALORIES: Around 600 - 700 calories

INGREDIENTS:

- Black Olives - 10 pcs or about 60 grams
- Old El Paso Salsa - 2 tablespoons
- Parmesan Cheese (or similar hard cheese) - 30 grams grated
- Mustard (brand starting with "Maille") - 1 tablespoons
- Sweetcorn - 2 tablespoons,
- Chilled Spreadable Product (Butter/Margarine) - 1 tablespoons
- Herb or Seasoning - A pinch (as per your taste)

The rest of the ingredients are optional and can be added as per the taste.

PREPARATION:

1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius.

2. De-stone and carefully hollow out the black olives. This can be a delicate process, but remember, the olive only needs to hold enough of the stuffing.

3. In a bowl, mix the grated Parmesan cheese and salsa together. You might need to blend the salsa into a more paste-like consistency before mixing it with the cheese. The mixture should be easy to spoon into the olives, but not too liquid.

4. Very carefully, using a small spoon or a piping bag, stuff the hollowed out olives with the cheese and salsa mixture.

5. Arrange the stuffed olives on a baking tray lined with baking paper. You might want to stick a single toothpick through each olive to secure its structure.

6. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the olives are sizzling and the cheese melted.

7. While that is in the oven, make the Mustard Sweetcorn Sauce. Start by melting the chilled spreadable product in a saucepan over medium heat.

8. Drain the sweetcorn and add them to the saucepan. Saut√© until they started to brown.

9. Add the mustard and seasoning (add gradually and taste, until it suits your preference). Turn down the heat and keep stirring until everything is well combined. If the mixture gets too dry, you can loosen it up with a splash of sparkling wine.

10. Serve the baked olives hot from the oven with the Mustard Sweetcorn Sauce on the side.

Enjoy your Gourmet Salsa Parmigiano Stuffed Baked Olives with Mustard Sweetcorn Sauce! This recipe can be a unique and delightful appetizer or a light main dish.

TIP:
- Olives and cheese can be quite salty, so approach this recipe with a moderate hand when it comes to seasoning. You can even rinse the olives in water before stuffing them to dial back the brine's impact on the final taste.
