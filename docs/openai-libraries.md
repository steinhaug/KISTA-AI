# Open-AI Libraries

## PHP libraries

### Chosen library:

[openai-php/client](https://github.com/openai-php/client)

Obviously a more robust and powerful library at first glance as all functions are working. All needed functions have been tested against API and I am ready to put it all together.

### Other libraries:

[orhanerday/open-ai](https://github.com/orhanerday/open-ai)
[webman-php/openai](https://github.com/webman-php/openai)

## Python libraries

### Official python library:

[openai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries)
